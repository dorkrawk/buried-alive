# Buried Alive

A Chrome extension to prevent you from becoming a bookmark horder.

*NOTE! It is still being built and not quite functional yet!*

## Why Does This Exist?

I often find myself with a lot of tabs open but not enough time to finish looking at them.  I want to come back to those pages, but bookmarking them feels so... permenet.  I don't want to become a bookmark horder and save everything that I didn't have time to finish looking at.  To aid in this process I created **Buried Alive**.  When you bookmark a page with Buried Alive it is added to a seperate bookmarks list ordered chronologically.  When you click on the link to go back to the page, the bookmark is automatically removed.

Don't get buried alive, get Buried Alive.
